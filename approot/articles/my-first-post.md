####Hold on to your Butts
OK so why is this first article titled "Hold on to your Butts"? I've spent about a month (on and off) developing this site with the desire to become more social in the community. In that month, I've needed some Lorem Ipsum text to fill the gaps within the site. I could think of no other tool than the Samuel L Ipsum generator
[http://slipsum.com/](http://slipsum.com/ "Samuel L. Ipsum"). Tons of fun right?

While this first post is going to be extremely short, here is a list of topics to look forward to.

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/ "Node.js")
* [Socket.io](http://socket.io/ "Node.js and Sockets with Socket.io")
* [JMeter](http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/ "JMeter Apache Project")
* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2 "Sublime Text 2")
* [ColdFusion](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html "ColdFusion")

And much more!

Here is the initial performance test of maurer.me using Node.js and Cluster with 4 workers.
